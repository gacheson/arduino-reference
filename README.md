arduino-reference
=================
This app is a quick reference for Arduino newbies and ethusiasts alike. Designed for simplicity and ease-of-use, structures, variables, and functions are grouped both visually and categorically. Each tile is labeled and, where applicable, includes a brief mention of its parameters. Tapping on one will open up a detailed explanation. The complete, online reference is accessible from the Settings charm.
